# Ethicality
A project to create a multiplatform webapp that allows to query brands and see what's their *ethical profile* (information about the good and bad deeds from a company) so users can make better purchase decisions.

# Development
At this point is still early in the project to have contributors, but if by any chance you are reading this and are interested, please ping me.

To run it, you need to clone this repo, and have [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/) installed. Then run:
```
meteor npm install
meteor run
```

To run it on Android or iOS follow Meteor's documentation.

# Documentation
For an overview of the project and it's roadmap, head to the [wiki](https://github.com/cvielma/ethicality/wiki).
For technical documentation, check:

I'm using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) through [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools), so you can find certain decisions documented inside the doc/adr folder.
